CDN

As on dec, 2019 3.4.1

Selectors:- $('').method()

We can work with attributes as Selectors

Events:
NOTE:- if JS (script) is written/ placed above html, then some parts will NOT work properly
as the script runs even before the page is fully loaded (as needed)
So in the case of jQuery, in order to prevent to this use,

$(document).ready(function(){
  //place code here
})

Here it says, don't run the code within until document is ready (loaded)
But in general using,
$(document).ready(function(){

})
anywhere will be helpful

hover is a short hand syntax for mouse enter + mouse leave

focus event - clicking on an input, seting off a focus
this - keyword.. to set the context of the particular clicked field

blur event - opposite of focus


DOM manipulation:
Document Object Model
We can add and remove classes

Also we can toggle classes

Adding and changing content from within the DOM

append
prepend

.empty()
.detach() - to detach an element from the DOM

We can also work with attributes
we can set & get attribute values using 'attr'
Also, $('').removeAttr('')

wrap - wraps specific elements in other elements

NOTE: multiple css props/values - within object as key: value pairs

Arrays
to loop thru' an array, use 'each' loop
also, toArray() - to turn existing list into an array


Effects & Animation
fadeOut, fadeIn, SlideUp, SlideDown
animate functions

$('').fadeOut('fast')
$('').fadeOut('slow')
$('').fadeOut(3000)
$('').fadeOut(3000, function(){

})
This CBF is optional, that do something when its done

similarly, slideUp, slideDown, slideToggle

$('').animate({ key: value })

queue - to do multiple animations at once


AJAX
Async JS & XML
updating of UI/ data, server req without refreshing the page
fetch JSON

.load('file.html', function(){

})

.get()

In $.ajax({}), the default method is GET

Also $.map()
